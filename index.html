  <H2>UNDERSTANDING THE WEB</H2>
	<p> You access the Internet via a <b>browser</b> on your computer <em>(e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.)</em>.
	    The Internet protocol, <b>HTTP</b>, manages how data is transferred from your browser to the Internet 
	    and then back to your computer. The Internet is comprised of millions of <b>servers</b> which communicate
	    and send back <i>(via HTTP)</i> data based on what you're doing via your browser. Most of what you see
            on the Internet are <b>HTML</b> files.</p>

<H2>BEGINNING HTML</H2>
	<p> HTML is the language of the Internet. The HTML language is comprised of <b>tags</b> and <b>elements</b>.
	    Most HTML tags have both an "opening" tag and a "closing" tag. The content you want to effect with the tag
            should be written between the "opening" and "closing" tag(s). HTML tags that do not "close" <em>(i.e., do not
            have a "closing" tag)</em> are called <b>void</b> tags.</p>

	    <p> Every HTML page must begin with certain "system information". This information is read by the browser and 
		must be stored in the HTML "header". HTML "header" information is everything above the opening <b><em>body</em></b> tag.
		Everything between the "opening" <b><em>body</em></b> tag and the "closing <b><em>body</em></b> tag is what 
		will appear on your webpage.</p>

  <H2>TEXT FORMATTING WITH HTML</H2>

  <H3>BOLD & ITALICS:</H3>

  <b>This is BOLDED text, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML 5.</b>
  <strong>This is also BOLDED text. This is the current, supported tag for bolding text in HTML 5.</strong>
 <br>

  <i>This is ITALICIZED text, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML 5.</i>
  <em>This is also ITALICIZED text. This is the current, supported tag for italicizing text in HTML 5.</em>
 <br>
<!--The tag above is a line break. REMEMBER: This is a comment tag. The web browser will not display this text on the webpage-->

  <H2>INLINE & BLOCK ELEMENTS</H2>
	<p> <strong>Inline</strong> elements <em>(such as the "anchor", "line break", "image", and "span" tags)</em> are 
		HTML tags that do not affect the area around the text. It treats the text like other text on the same line.</p> 

		<strong>Block</strong> elements <em>(such as the "paragraph", "form", and "div" tags)</em> are HTML tags that 
		do affect the area around the text by essentially putting an <em>invisible box</em> around the text, allowing 
		you to set the specific width and/or height of the <em>box</em>. <strong>Block</strong> tags will push text 
		not enclosed in the tags to another line.</p>
